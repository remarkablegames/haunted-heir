    lord "Good morning. I hope you had a productive night." 
    player "I spoke with some creepy-looking ghosts. I don't know that I would say it was productive." 
    lord "Give it time. It would be foolish to think such a matter would be handled in a single night."
    #player "Do all ghosts look similar?" 
    #lord "No, they come in a wide variety of different shapes and forms." 
    player "I didn't really get anywhere with either of the ghosts I talked to. I'm not so sure this is going to work. If they’re really trapped here, I don’t see how talking to them is going to change that?" 
    lord "A fair question. Think of it as us giving them the support they need. An intact soul inherently has the ability to crossover to the other side on its own. But if they don't want to cross over, or don't know that they can, then they usually won’t. In a way, your role is not so different from that of the psychopomps of mythology, such as valkyries, shinigami, or the ferryman of the river Styx."
    player "I see. But what if they don’t want to go? It seems wrong to try and force them. What's wrong with just letting them be?" 
    lord "How astute. A few reasons. The first is that certain dangers can arise if a soul remains on this side for too long. But more pertinent is the fact that these are not normal souls." 
    player "Not normal? What do you mean?" 
    lord "When someone dies, their soul is released from their body, creating a single spirit. But sometimes, their soul shatters into multiple fragments or shards. These individual shards cannot pass over on their own, even if they want to. Unless these shards are reunited into a single, complete soul, they will forever remain trapped in the realm between."
    player "Hmm.  So my end goal is to reunite them.  Okay.  That seems… doable. Not the worst way to become rich, either.  I guess I'll try to talk to the ghosts again tonight."
