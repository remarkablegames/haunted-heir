    "You’re surprised to hear noise coming from the kitchen"
    player "Is someone else in here? Hello?"
    kitchen_ghost "Excuse me, sir. Are you making dinner?"
    "You’re a little startled at first. You think the dark is playing tricks on you. You take a moment to get a closer look at what’s in front of you."
    "And then you run. Is this just a nightmare? Maybe, but no time to look back."
    "You return to the safety of your well lit room, deciding you’re not so hungry after all."
